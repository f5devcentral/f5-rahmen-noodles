iApp requires: BIG-IP version 11.5.3 - 12.1.2

Introduction
This F5 iApp for NIST SP-800-53r4 allows you to configure a BIG-IP device to support 
security controls according to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) Special Publication 800-53 (Revision 4): Security and Privacy Controls for Federal
Information Systems and Organizations (updated 01-02-2015).

NIST SP-800-53r4 is a complex document. Only some of the controls (that is, policies plus supporting 
technical measures) that organizations adopt to comply with SP-800-53r4 relate to the BIG-IP 
configuration. The associated deployment guide discusses the security controls in Appendix F 
of NIST SP-800-53r4 most applicable to BIG-IP configuration and shows how to support them.


Deployment Guide 
F5 very strongly recommends reading the deployment guide before
attempting to use this iApp template. The deployment guide with detailed instructions 
and prerequisites is located at http://f5.com/pdf/deployment-guides/nist-sp-800-53-r4-dg.pdf


Importing and Using the Template

Extract the template file in a location accessible by the BIG-IP system. From
the BIG-IP Configuration utility, on the Main tab, expand 'iApp' and then click
'Templates'. Click 'Import' and then click the 'Browse' button to select the
template file 'f5.nist_sp800_53.v1.0.0'. Click 'Upload' to
install the template to your BIG-IP system.


New Features and configuration changes:

- All customer secrets/passwords in the iApp template are now securely stored.  Previously, although secrets were stored in Secure Vault for use, some may have been stored in cleartext in the iApp reconfiguration data. 
- Added support for BIG-IP versions 12.1 - 12.1.2.
- Made error messages produced by the template easier to understand.
- If using RADIUS authentication, you are now limited a maximum of 10 servers.  Previously there was no limit.

Issues resolved:

- The source-IP option on additional syslog servers is honored in this version, previously this field was ignored.
